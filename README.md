# Disparity-estimation-of-different-views-of-same-scene
Given an image dataset which has three views of the same scene and ground truth disparities of two views, implemented disparity estimation from rectified images using basic block matching and dynamic programming. Also implements View Synthesis which is an interesting application of Stereo Vision.
